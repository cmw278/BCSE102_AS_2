This Git was created for the purpose of version control for the
second assignment in my second semester programming paper.

The base code for this assignment is not my own, but sourced 
from the 3rd edition of Eloquent JavaScript, written by
Marijn Haverbeke ( https://eloquentjavascript.net ).

Any and all subsequent modifications made to this game are my
own.
